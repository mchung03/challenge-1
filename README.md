# Challenge-1

## Description

I built this project to practice refactoring code. The given code was unorganized and spread out. I learned how to replace non-semantic elements with semantic HTML elements and find out how to consolidate repeated code. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this website, click on the links in the navigation bar for it to drop down to its section. The function of the website did not change because of refactoring. But if you open the code in VS code or GitHub, you will see that it is more organized and easy to read.
